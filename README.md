# AnimeDB

AnimeDB is a site where anime fans can come and find information on all the top anime, watch trailers and post and read reviews. This project was motivated by team member interest, the growing popularity of anime, and the overall dated look of other anime database sites. AnimeDB fills the need for a modern anime site for fans.

## User Story

Upon navigating to AnimeDB, a user is meet with an exciting carousel of anime gifs. From there, the user can log in and go to the Anime Library, or simply skip logging in and click the Anime Library button. Here they can see a list of featured anime and click on any to get more details. Clicking an anime entry will take the user to a dedicated page for that anime where they can find more information, watch a trailer and post a review. 

## Future Improvements

The AnimeDB team plans to create a secure user login, including choosing or uploading an avatar. Having a secure account users can return to will allow users to post reviews connected to their user account, manage their reviews, including deleting/editing them, and respond to others' reviews. Additionally, we want to add the ability for users to "favorite" individual anime and keep track of their favorited anime in their profile. Finally, we want to add a search function to not only search for specific anime but also search for a list of anime by genre, dates, currently airing, etc.
